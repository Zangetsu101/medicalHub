The project aimed to help doctors and patients better maintaining their records, appointments in an organized way. Laravel framework was used for the development of web application and MySQL for database management.
Doctors can see their schedule for any given day. They can reschedule any appointments if needed. They can check the status of patients under their supervision. They can access patient history automatically if an appointment is made. A prescription can be prescribed digitally for an appointment.
Patients can see their upcoming appointments. They can access their medical history and prescriptions. Heart rate and weight history can be seen in graphical form. 
Any user can search for doctors using specialization, their workplace, and office time. Users can also search for hospitals and doctors in that particular hospital. Appointments can be made if a user is registered.
Admin module is needed to register hospitals and doctors in the system. It's also needed to update any change on doctor profile such as office hours, professional specializations, etc.
